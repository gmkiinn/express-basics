## Middleware

**_Middleware_** is a function, which takes the request, process it and sends the request to another middleware or completes the request responce cycle by sending the response.

Express Application is nothing but bunch of middlewares. The process of request going through middlewares is nothing but **Request Processing Pipeline**

In the coming days I will update the repo for clean code and readme.md for well document.stay tuned.
